# SQL-Project

SQL-based data analysis on pizza sales involves querying and analyzing sales data to identify trends, optimize inventory, and improve decision-making. Analysts can use SQL to extract insights like top-selling pizzas, peak sales times, average order values, and customer purchase behavior. For instance, SQL queries can aggregate sales by pizza type, date, and location, allowing businesses to pinpoint high-demand periods and adjust promotions or staffing. Additionally, SQL can be used to analyze customer demographics and frequency of purchases, helping businesses to tailor marketing strategies and improve customer satisfaction.
